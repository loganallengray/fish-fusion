/*
    The boat will have many fish.
    Each fish will be represented by an object.
    Here are the properties of each fish.
        Species
        Weight
        Price (prices range from $3.00 to $10.00 per fish)
        Amount (how many of this species were caught today)

    Next, the fishing boat must have a function that the other 
    modules can invoke in order to see today's catch.
    This function must be named boatInventory.
    The array of fish objects will be the return value when the 
    function is invoked (see data below).
